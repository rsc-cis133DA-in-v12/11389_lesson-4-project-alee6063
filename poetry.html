         <h2>If You Give Up</h2>
            <p>By: Catherine Pulsifer</p>

            <p>If you give up what will that achieve?
                <br>Will you feel like you've met your needs?
                <br>Giving up can make you feel
                <br>Worse than losing a deal.</p>
                
            <p>Do you give in when things get hard?
                <br>Throw up your hands with no regard.
                <br>Giving up on your dreams
                <br>No longer moving forward with any steam.</p>
                
            <p>When things get difficult for you
                <br>Do you accept defeat too?
                <br>Throw in the towel and say
                <br>No more, I have had it for the day.</p>
                
            <p>But when you never give up
                <br>You find solutions popping up.
                <br>Yes you may have to walk away
                <br>But only for one day.</p>
                
            <p>Sometimes taking a break
                <br>Is a good thing for your sake.
                <br>When faced with a challenging task
                <br>Find others who can help, just ask.</p>
                
            <p>When you never give up you will find
                <br>A success that is like any other kind.
                <br><strong>If everything was easy and quick to do
                <br>There would be no satisfaction for you.</strong></p>
            <!--I found this sentence important because it provides a great way of letting people know that the struggle is worth it.-->
                
            <p>You see, in life, we all must face
                <br>Times when we feel we are in the wrong place.
                <br>But we never give up and accept defeat
                <br>For you will find determination is sweet!</p>
